\section{How to make him comfortable around other babies}
\subsection{chatgpt}

To help your 1.5-year-old son become more comfortable around other babies, you can take a gradual and supportive approach:

% bold
\textbf{Start with Small, Controlled Playdates}: Arrange short playdates with one or two babies in familiar settings. Keep them brief to avoid overwhelming him.

\textbf{Lead by Example}: Show a calm and friendly attitude when interacting with other babies. Your son may pick up on your behavior and feel more at ease.

\textbf{Introduce Social Situations Gradually}: Take him to places where he can observe other babies from a distance before gradually moving closer. This helps him acclimate without pressure.

\textbf{Praise and Encourage}: When he approaches or interacts with other babies, offer praise and positive reinforcement. Keep the atmosphere relaxed and fun.

\textbf{Bring Familiar Comfort Items}: A favorite toy or blanket can help your son feel more secure in new environments.

\textbf{Model Gentle Play}: Gently guide him in interacting with other babies, like showing how to share toys or play together. This helps him understand what to expect.

\textbf{Observe and Respect Boundaries}: If he shows discomfort, give him time and space without forcing interactions. Pushing too hard may reinforce fear.

With patience, heâ€™ll likely grow more comfortable over time.
